## About

Hematite, ~~is an iron oxide crystal which~~ -- is an atempt to allow Prismluancher to be extended and contributed to via rust.
It is not an attempt to rewrite the whole of Prism with rust. Currently an expariment to see if the process feels comfortable.

Some of the initial decision will be wrong, some will feel like the "hard way" these are all nessacery to feel out the right and wrong way to go about it.
